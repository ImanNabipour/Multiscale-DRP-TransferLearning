# Multiscale-DRP-TransferLearning
 Open-source code for our multiscale transfer learning approach in digital rock physics. Using multi-resolution (HR, MR, LR) micro-CT images, the workflow efficiently predicts permeability in tight carbonate rocks by employing microporous insights from fine-scale scans.
