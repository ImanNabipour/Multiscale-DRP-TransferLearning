# Multiscale-DRP-TransferLearning
This repository provides open-source code for our multiscale transfer learning approach in digital rock physics. Using micro-CT images at multiple resolutions (HR, MR, LR), our workflow efficiently predicts permeability in tight carbonate rocks by reusing crucial microporous insights from fine-scale scans. The code demonstrates how data-driven methods, combined with domain-specific preprocessing (e.g., Euclidean Distance Transform), enable scale-aware permeability estimation for heterogeneous formations.
